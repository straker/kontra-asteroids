# Kontra.js Asteroids

A simple Asteroids game made in Kontra.js. Based on the tutorial found at https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f

Also showcases how to bundle the code using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [esbuild-plugin-kontra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugin-kontra) to reduce the file size to only what's used, and [js13k-packer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js13k-packer) to optimally package the game for submission.

## Development

Run `npm run build` to build the game using esbuild. Run `npm run pack` to package the game using js13k-packer.
